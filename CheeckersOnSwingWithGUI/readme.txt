This is a Checkers Game with Graphical User Interface made on java swing.
Default mode is PVP
AI is only implemented for the black player, and it is not really sophisticated for now,
therefore if you want to play againts computer, you have to play as the whites.
Changing of modes during the play is not yet implemented, 
if you change from pvp to ai during the play, the ai will start to move black pawns accordingly, 
but the board will not reset itself to default.
The same applies to victory, there is no "board-reset" implemented, if you want to play again, you need to restart the application.

This is 1st project of the Java_Coding_Ventures initiative, made by myself in order to pratice and improve my skills.
